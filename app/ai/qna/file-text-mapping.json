The heating elements used in kettles and irons are made of nichrome \nwire which is coiled round an insulating fire -proof material such as silica or fire -clay. \nNichrome is chosen because of its high r esistivity and its ability to withstand high temperatures \nwithout being easily oxidised. \nIn the case of an electric kettle, the heating element is enclosed in a metal tube. Heat is generated when an electric current is passed through the heating element.  The water \nsurrounding it gets heated by conduction and convection. In the case of an electric iron, the heat generated by the heating element is spread evenly over a metal base which is a good conductor of heat. A thermostat inside the iron controls the temperature of the heating element.  \n b) Electric lighting  \n1.   Incandescent (or filament) lamps  \nThe filament lamp works on the heating \neffect of a current . The wire which is used to \nmake the filament is tungsten. Tungsten is chosen because of its high res istivity and high \nmelting point (3400\noC). Besides being made \nof a high resistivity material, the filament is made very thin (i.e. small cross -sectional \narea) to give it a higher resistance than the rest of the circuit.  \n When a current flows through the \nfilament, the filament becomes white hot \n(about 2500oC). The higher the temperature \nof the filament, the greater is the proportion of electric energy that is converted to light energy. This explains why tungsten with a high melting point of 3400\noC is chosen. \n \n \n /Sec4/ Physics /Domestic -notes  Page 2 of 9 The purpose of the coiled coil is to make the filament compact as well as to reduce the \nconvection currents being set up in the gas within the glass bulb. This glass bulb is usually filled with argon or nitrogen (both being inert gases) as tungsten oxidi zes at high temperatures when \nexposed to air. The filament lamp has two disadvantages:  \n\u2022 only about 10% of the electrical energy supplied is converted to light. The rest of the energy is converted to heat. This explains why it is very warm when you use a fil ament lamp.  \n\u2022 compared with the fluorescent lamp, the filament lamp casts shard shadows and this is not desirable in schools or offices. However, it is commonly used in homes to give an impression of a more cozy and relaxed atmosphere. \n 2.   Fluorescent lamps  \nCompared to filament lamps, fluorescent lamps are about three times as efficient. They are therefore more economical to use. In addition, fluorescent lamps have a lamp life of about 3000 hours compared to the 1000 hours of filament lamps. Unlike the fila ment lamp, a fluorescent lamp has no filament but two electrodes. By passing \nelectric charges between these two electrodes, the mercury vapour in the glass tube emits ultraviolet light together with other visible light. This ultraviolet light is converted to visible light by the fluorescent powder on the inside of the glass tube.  c) Electric motors  \nThe electric motors used in household appliances like the fan, washing machine, hair dryer are based on the magnetic effect of a current . \nIn the magnetic effect  of a current, the magnetic field of a current is used to interact with other \nmagnetic fields or magnetic materials to produce mechanical movements.  \n  \nMeasurement of Electrical Energy  \n a) Calculating electrical power and energy  \n1.

If the operating current \nflowing through it is 4.0 A, calculate   (i) the supply voltage;   (ii) the electrical power produced; \nand (iii) the heat energy produced in 5 minutes. \n      /Sec4/ Physics /Domestic -notes  Page 3 of 9 Ex-2: A filament lamp is rated 60 W and 240 V. Find  (i) the current flowing through the \nlamp; (ii) the resistance of the filament; and   (iii) the energy produced by the lamp in one hour. \n \n                b) Calculating the c ost of electricity consumption  \nThe cost of electricity consumption is based on the number of kilowatt -hours (kWh) of \nelectrical energy used. The kWh are sometimes known as the domestic units of electricity.  \n \nEx-3: Change 1 kWh to Joules. \n          \nEx-4: If the Singapore Power charges 27.59 cents for each kWh of electrical energy used  \n(based on the 1- Jan to 31- Mar 2012 tariff), calculate the total cost of using a 3 kW electric kettle \nfor 20 minutes and a 100 W filament bulb for 5 hours. \n         /Sec4/ Physics /Domestic -notes  Page 4 of 9 Dangers of Electricity  \n \na) Damaged insulation  \nAll electrical appliances require two wires to form a complete circuit from the voltage supply to the appliance and back to the supply. The two wires are called the LIVE  and NEUTRAL  wires.  \nThe live wire is the dangerous w ire because it carries a very high voltage while the neutral wire \ncarries close to zero voltage. These two wires are insulated in vulcanized rubber and they are \nhoused together in either a circular PVC sheathed cable or a circular braided rubber -insulated \ncable.  \nInsulating material deteriorate with time and use. For example, the electrical cables connecting \nthe hair dryer and the electric iron are always bent and twisted because of the way the appliances are used. This will cause the electrical insulation t o crack and break, thus exposing \nthe conducting wires inside. If the vulcanized rubber covering the live wire is also damaged, the exposed live wire can cause a severe electric shock to the user if the user touches it accidentally. \nThis can lead to serious  injury and even death. \n \nb) Overheating of cables  \nThe overheating of cables refers to the unusually large current flowing in the conducting wires under certain conditions such as short circuit or overloading  \nA short circuit can result when the live wire ma kes contact with the neutral wire due to a \ndamaged insulation between them. This will produce a large current and the large amount of heat generated can melt the insulation and start a fire.  \n c) Damp conditions  \nIf water from the wet floor touches the live wire, it provides a conducting path for a large amount of current to flow through it and through the body of the person. The human body can only withstand up to about 50 mA but the current in this case is very much higher due to the sharp decrease in the r esistance of the body. \nThe electrical resistance of the human body comprises two parts: the contact resistance of the dry skin and the resistance of the body itself. The contact resistance of the dry skin is of the \norder of 100 k\u2126  or more while the resista nce of the body containing mainly fluids is much \nlower (of the order of a few hundred ohms). This explains why the dry skin acts as an insulating layer by offering high resistance. If the skin is wet, the contact resistance provided by the dry skin will be  lowered drastically and the resistance of the body being very low will allow a large \nelectric current to flow through the body, causing an electric shock and even death.  \n \nSafe Use of Electricity at Home \n \na) Household electricity supply  \nThe figure shows a  typical house circuit. Electricity is supplied to the house by an underground \ncable containing two wires, the live (L) wire  and the neutral (N) wire . For any circuit, the \ncurrent enters the house through one wire and returns to the local substation throug h the other. \nThe live (L) wire is a dangerous wire as it carries a high voltage while the neutral (N) wire is usually at zero volt. \nThese two wires are connected to a mains fuse box, an electricity meter and then to a \nconsumer unit. The consumer unit is the distribution point for the household\u2019s electricity supply. The same figure shown also shows the consumer unit containing a main switch and four fuses which lead to different circuits in the house.  /Sec4/ Physics /Domestic -notes  Page 5 of 9 These circuits are:  \n\u2022 lighting circuit : the lamps are al ways connected in parallel so that each lamp receives the \nmains voltage of 240 V. In addition, if any lamp should fail, the rest of the lamps will not be \naffected since they are connected in parallel  \n\u2022 immersion heater circuit \n\u2022 cooker circuit  \n\u2022 ring main circuit  : this circuit supplies electricity to all the wall sockets in the house. \nBesides both the live and neutral wires running a complete ring round the house, an earth (E) wire is also added for safety reasons.  \nThe Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) is com monly used to protect users by cutting off \nthe supply whenever a current leakage of 30 mA is detected in the circuit.  \n  \n  \n  /Sec4/ Physics /Domestic -notes  Page 6 of 9 Fuses \n The same figure above also shows fuses found in the main fuse box as well as in the \nconsumer unit. A fuse  is a safety device that is inserted into an electrical circuit to protect the \nequipment and wiring against any excessive current flow. It is a short thin piece of wire which \nbecomes hot and melts when the current through it is greater than its rated value. \n The thicker the wire, the more current is needed to melt it and the higher the rating of the \nfuse. Fuses are normally rated at 1 A, 2 A, 5 A, 10 A and 13 A. \nAs a safety measure, the following should be considered:  \n\u2022 fuses to be used should have a rating of just slightly mor e than the current which the \nelectrical appliance will draw under normal conditions. \n\u2022 fuses should be connected to the live wire  so that the appliance will not become live  after \nthe fuse has blown \n\u2022 before changing any fuse, switch off the mains. \n \nEx : A hot water heater is rated 2880 W 240 V. Calculate the operating current and suggest a \nsuitable rating for a fuse to be used to protect the heater from overloading. \n \n         \nPlugs and sockets \n The figures show a typical power socket and a plug used in a hous e. The function of a fused \nplug is to connect a portable appliance (such as an electric kettle) to the power circuits via the power socket. The modern fused plug is a three -pin plug which has flat pins. \n Within the plug, a cartridge fuse is fitted neatly  into a carrier in the plug. The plug fuse protects \nthe individual appliance in the event of an electrical fault. When the plug fuse \u2018blows\u2019, it only isolates the appliance concerned so that the other appliances plugged into the ring main circuit can still function.   \n \n  /Sec4/ Physics /Domestic -notes  Page 7 of 9 Switches \n All switches are designed to perform the same function of breaking or completing an \nelectrical circuit. An important precaution is that any switch must be fitted onto the live wire, as \nshown in Fig A, so that the action of switching  off will disconnect the high voltage from an \nappliance.  \n If the switch is fitted onto the neutral wire, the appliance will be \u2018live\u2019 even if the switch is \u2018off\u2019. An electric shock could then result, as shown in Fig B.    \nEarthing  \n All appliances need at  least two wires (the live and the neutral) to form a complete circuit \nfrom the supply through the appliance and back to the supply. \nThe live (L) wire [ brown ] delivers the energy at the high alternating voltage (a.c.) to the \nappliance. The neutral (N) wire [ blue] completes the circuit by forming a path for the current \nback to the supply. It is usually at zero volt.  \n /Sec4/ Physics /Domestic -notes  Page 8 of 9  \nThe earth (E) wire [ green with yellow ] is a low resistance wire, usually connected to the metal \ncasing of the appliance. Earthing protects any user of the appliance from an electric shock, if the \nmetal casing should accidentally become live (e.g. when the live wire is not properly fixed on and touches the metal casing of the appliance). The large current that flows from the loose wire through the metal casing and the earth wire ( a low resistance wire) will blow the circuit fuse and cut off the supply to the appliance.  \n The figure on the right shows how \nthe earth wire is connected to the body of the electric iron.  \n  The following figures show the importance of earthing as a safety precaution. \n \n \n /Sec4/ Physics /Domestic -notes  Page 9 of 9 Double insulation  \n Double insulation is a safety feature in an electrical appliance that can substitute for an earth \nwire. In this case, only the live and neutral wires are required for the appliance. \nThis safety feature provides two levels of insulation:  \n\u2022 the electric cable is insulated from the internal components of the appliance \n\u2022 the internal metal parts which could become live if a fault developed are also insulated from \nthe external casing  \nAppliances  with this feature normally have non- metallic casing (such as plastics).  \n  \nSources of electrical energy  \nIn Singapore, the majority of the electrical energy consumed is produced by burning fossil \nfuels .  \nOur dependency on other countries for fossil fuels and the negative effects of burning \nfossil fuels on the environment point to a need for alternative sources of energy. Fossil fuels are \na non -renewable source of energy.  \n \nRenewable energy  is defined as energy from sources th at can be replenished naturally, s uch as \nthe examples in the table.  \n Solar power  Hydroelectric power  Wind power  \nEfficiency  High efficiency when \nthere is daylight and \nminimal cloud cover  Most efficient energy \nsource  \n Efficiency depends on \nwind direction and \nspeed  \nCost  \u2022 Solar panel cost is \nhigh \n\u2022 Cost of fuel is free  Cost of constructing \nand maintaining dam \nand power plant is high  Cost falling with \nimproving technology  \nEnvironmental \nimpact  Clean energy, but \nrequires large areas to \nbe cleared for solar \npanel installation  Clean energy, but dam \nconstruction disrupts ecosystems\n Clean energy, but \nrequires large open areas and possible noise \npollution  \n \nNon-renewable energy is defined as energy from natural sources that cannot be re plenished at \na sustainable rate, such as the examples in the table.  \n Nuclear power  Fossil fuels  \nEfficiency  High efficiency  Most countries have well -established \nfossil fuel power plants  \nCost  Additional cost incurred for disposal \nof radioactive waste  Cost rising due to declining supplies  \nEnvironmental \nimpact  Waste produce d can contaminate \ngroundwater and sources of surface \nwater  \u2022 Mining disrupts ecosystems  \n\u2022 Burning fossil fuels results in air \npollution  \n \n \n \n \n----- end ----- \n ", "Domestic-Electricity/0": "Topic is Domestic-Electricity; /Sec4/ Physics /Domestic -notes Page 1 of 9 Hwa Chong Institution ( High School ) Name : _________________________ (   )  PHYSICS Notes Class : __________  Domestic Electricity Date : __________  Some uses of electricity   a) Electric heating  The following figures show some examples of household appl iances that are based on the heating effect of a current .

Summary  \nThe following summarises what had been discussed.  \n\u2666 Since the galvanometer shows a deflection \ntowards the left, there must be a current flowing through the circuit. \n\u2666 The presence of this induced current also means that an induced e.m.f. is generated in the circuit. This induced e.m.f. is responsible for driving the induced current round the closed circuit. The induced current on the right-hand side of the coil flows in a clockwise direction. \n  \n \n \n Sec4/ Physics /EMI-notes  Page 4 of 11  \n \n\u25ca Since the galvanometer shows no deflection, there \nis no induced current flowing in the circuit. \n       \n\u2666 Since the galvanometer shows a deflection \ntowards the right, there must be a current flowing through the circuit. \n\u2666 The direction of the induced current is opposite to that for Fig A as shown by the deflection in the opposite direction. The induced current on the right -hand side of the coil flows in an \nanticlockwise direction.  \n   \n\u25ca The galvanometer shows a deflection towards the \nright indicating the presence of an induced \ncurrent.  \n\u25ca The induced current on the right -hand side of the \ncoil flows in an ant iclockwise direction.  \n     \n\u2666 The galvanometer shows no deflection and this \nindicates the absence of any induced current.  \n      \n\u25ca The galvanometer shows a deflection towards the \nleft indicating the presence of an induced current. \n\u25ca The direction of the induce d current for Fig F is \nopposite to that for Fig D. The induced current on the right -hand side of the coil flows in a clockwise \ndirection. \n  \n \n \n \n \n Sec4/ Physics/EMI -notes  Page 5 of 11 \n We can make two important conclusions: \n\u21d2 Whenever there is movement of the magnet relative to the coil an induced e.m.f. (and \nhence an induced current in a closed circuit) is generated in the circuit. An induced e.m.f. can also be generated by moving the coil relative to the magnet so long as there is a change in the magnetic lines of force passing through the coil (Fara day's Law).  \n\u21d2 The direction of the induced e.m.f. (taken to be the direction of the induced current) is such that the magnetic field created always opposes the motion w hich produces it (Lenz's \nLaw). This can be seen in Figs A, C, D and F. For example in Fig A, as the S -pole of the \nmagnet moves into the right-hand side (RHS) of the coil, there is an increase in the strength of the mag netic field affecting the coil.  To oppose the increase in the strength of \nthe magnetic field, the induced current moves in a dir ection so as to create a S- pole at the \nRHS of the coil. The S -pole at the RHS of the coil repels the S -pole of the approaching \nmagnet. Similarly, in Fig C, when the S -pole of the magnet moves away from the RHS of \nthe coil, the magnetic field af fecting the coil decreases. To oppose the decrease in the \nstrength of the magnetic field, the induced current moves in a direction so as to create an N-pole at the RHS of the coil. The N -pole at the RHS of the coil attracts the S -pole of the \nmagnet that is moving away . \n  6. Lenz\u2019s Law and the conservation of energy When a magnet is moved into a coil, mechanical work is done to overcome the repulsion between like poles. This mechanical work is transformed into electrical energy as indicated by the induced current flowing in the circuit.  \n  The same effect is experienced when the magnet is pulled out of the coil. Mechanical work is done to overcome the attraction between the unlike poles which is again transformed into electrical energy.  \n  \nC. Generating Electricity  \n 1. The simple a.c. (alternating -current) generator  \n\u2666 The figure shows a simple a.c. generator. As the \ncoil rotates , the magnetic field through the coil \nchanges  and therefore induces an e.m.f. between \nthe ends of the coil. The induced current does not flow unless the ends of the coil are connected to an external circuit with an electrical load such as a resistor.  \n\u2666 The slip rings  ensure that the direction of the \ninduced current flowing in the external circuit changes every half revolution. In other words, \nthe output voltage or current is alternating . The \ncarbon brushes provide sliding contact with the rotating slip rings.  \n   Sec4/ Physics/EMI -notes  Page 6 of 11 \n \n \n  \n\u25ca If the coil is viewed end -on, the positions \nof the coil that correspond to the induced \ne.m.f. are shown in the next figure. The \ninduced e.m.f. is maximum (E o) when \nthe plane of the coil is parallel  to the \nmagnetic lines of force because the sides AD and BC are cutting through the magnetic field at the greatest rate.  \n   \n\u25ca The induced e.m.f. is zero  when the plane of the coil is perpendicular to th e magnetic lines \nof force because the sides AD and BC are moving parallel to the magnetic field and hence not cutting through the magnetic field lines. The frequency of the rotation is related to its \nperiod by the equation: 1f = T \n \n\u21d2 If we double the number of turns on the coil \nwithout changing the frequency of rotation of the coil, the output voltage has the waveform shown. \n          \n\u21d2 If we double the the frequency of rotation of \nthe coil  without changing the number of turns \non the coil, the maximum output voltage also doubles as shown in the figure. \n      Besides increasing the frequency of rotation of the coil and the number of the turns of the coil, the induced e.m.f. of an a.c. generator can also be increased: \n\u2022 by using stronger magnetic fields;  \n\u2022 by winding the coil on a soft iron core (to concentrate the magnetic lines of force \nthrough the coil)  \n Sec4/ Physics/EMI -notes  Page 7 of 11 \n \n 2. Other a.c. generators  \nTo generate large currents (as in a turbine power stations), it is more practical and \nadvantageous to keep the coil fix ed and to rotate the magnetic field (of an electromagnet) \naround the coil. In this way, instead of the coil cutting the magnetic field as in the simple a.c. generator, the magnetic field cuts the coil to produce the induced e.m.f.  Hence we can do away wit h the slip rings and the carbon brushes which are not capable of carrying large \ncurrents in and out of the coil. Other than the turbine, the bicycle dynamo also uses the method of rotating a magnet to produce an induced e.m.f. as shown.                  3. d.c. generator  \nThere is no structural differences between a d.c. motor (which requires  a current to flow in the \nwire) and a d.c. generator (which produces \ninduced current). Instead of the slip-rings as used in the a.c. generator, a split- ring commutato r is \nused. This means that when the coil is vertical, the commutator split is horizontal. The output current is a pulsating d.c. \n            Sec4/ Physics/EMI -notes  Page 8 of 11 \n D. Transformers  \n \n1. Various ways to use two coils to induce an output e.m.f.                    2. The transformer  \n \nA transformer is a device that changes a high alternating voltage (at low current) to a \nlow alternating voltage (at high current) , or vice versa. It is a useful electrical device that \nis essential for: \n\u2022 electrical power transmission from power station s to the consuming loads (households and \nfactories)  \n\u2022 regulating voltages for proper operation of electrical appliances such as mains -operated \nTV and record player  \n             \nThe structure  of a closed -core transformer basically consists of two coils of wi res (primary  \nand secondary ) of an appropriate number of turns. These coils are wound on a laminated soft-\niron core for reducing heat loss in the core. \n  a) b) \nc) d) Sec4/ Physics/EMI -notes  Page 9 of 11 SS\nPPVN = VN \nVS = secondary output voltage \nVP = primary input voltage \nNS = number of turns in secondary coil \nNP = number of turns in primary coil \n \nIP VP = IS VS \nIP = current in the primary coil  \nIS = current in the secondary coil  \nVS = secondary output voltage \nVP = primary input voltage \n The principle of operation \n\u2022 it transfers electrical energy supplied from the primary coil to the second ary coil by \nelectromagnetic induction between the two coils  \n\u2022 at the primary coil, the applied alternating voltage sets up an alternating magnetic field  to \ncut the secondary coil. This gives rise to a rate of change of magnetic field  across the \nsecondary coi l, and therefore an induced alternating e.m.f. is produced \n\u2022 a step -up transformer is one where the e.m.f. in the secondary coil is greater than the e.m.f. \nin the primary coil. Conversely, a step -down transformer is one where the e.m.f. in the \nsecondary coil  is less than the e.m.f. in the primary coil \n \n \nEquations  \n \nN\nNS\nP is commonly called turns ratio . \nFor a step -up transformer, N S > N P. \nConversely, for a step-down transformer, N\nS < N P. \n   \n \n For an ideal transformer (i.e. 100% efficient), the power supplied to the primary coil is fully transferred to the secondary coil. Hence by the principle of conservation of energy, \npower in primary coil = power in secondary coil  \n \n \n 3. Causes of loss of efficiency in a transformer  \n\u2022 \nFlux leakage : It is essential that all the flux generated by the primary passes through the \nsecondary. This is best achieved by winding the primary on top of the secondary; and having a \u2018closed\u2019 iron core. \n\u2022 \nLoss due to heating effect of eddy currents : The metal core is a conducto r and the \nmagnetic field varies continually. Hence an e.m.f. and consequently a current are induced in it. If the core is solid, it acts in effect as a secondary of one turn and a very large current is induced. The heating effect is proportional to the square of the current and is therefore quite large. The effect is very considerably reduced by using a bundle of very thin metal stampings (laminations) insulated from each other. Then the current induced in each is very small and there is only a small heatin g effect.  \n\u2022 \nCopper losses : These represent the energy lost by heating of the wire in both the primary \nand secondary coils ( because  \u221d  I2R ). \n\u2022 Hysteresis losses : The magnetic field in the core is in one direction 50 times each second \nand in the opposite direction 50 times each second. Consequently the domains are continually changing their alignment. The energy needed to effect this is taken from the input energy. \n Sec4/ Physics/EMI -notes  Page 10 of 11 Ex.1 :    A transformer has 400 turns in the primary winding and 10 turns in the secondary \nwinding. The primary e.m.f. is 250 V and the primary current is 2.0 A. Calculate \n(i) the secondary voltage;  \n(ii) the secondary current, assuming 100% efficiency. \n \n              \nEx.2 :    A step -down transformer is used to light a 12 V 24 W lamp from the 240 V mains. \nThe current through the primary is 125 mA. What is the efficiency of the transformer? \n                \nE. Transmission of Electricity  \n 1. Transmitting electricity economically  \nElectricity is transmitted from one part of the country to another by the grid syste m and is \ncarried by the pylons and wires strung across the countryside. Can you still see all these in Singapore? If not, how are the wires carried around the island?  One of the problems in the transmission and distribution of electrical energy is the pow er loss \nas heating ( I\n2R) in the grid cables. One solution is to have very thick cables so that the \nresistance R  is low. Then the power lost as heat in the cables will be a minimum. However, \nthere is a limit to the extent to which this can be done. The thic ker the cable used, the heavier \nis the weight to be supported and hence the higher the construction cost.  Sec4/ Physics/EMI -notes  Page 11 of 11 Another solution is to reduce the current I  in transfer. This can be done by using transformers \nto step up the voltage at which the electrical power  is to be transmitted. The greater the value \nof the voltage, the lower the power loss. Hence electrical power can be transmitted more \neconomically  at high voltage and low current \n          2. Alternating current and direct current  \nDirect current was used at one time, but alternating current is now preferred.  Why ?  \nBecause it can be stepped up and down much more easily. Direct current cannot be \nused with a transformer because a changing magnetic field is required . To step up d.c. \nvoltages is quite a complicated process. To step it down involves using resistors in series and \na considerable amount of energy is lost as heat.  \n  \nEx.3  :    Find the power wasted as internal energy in the cable when 10 kW is transmitted \nthrough a cable of resistance of 0.50 \u2126  \n(i) at 200 V; \n(ii) at 200 000 V. \n                      \n----- end ----- \n ", "Electromagnetic-Induction/0": "Topic is Electromagnetic-Induction; Sec4/ Physics/EMI -notes Page 1 of 11   Hwa Chong Institution (High School) Name : _________________________ (   ) PHYSICS Notes Class : __________  Electromagnetic Induction Date : __________  A.

Other a.c. generators  To generate large currents (as in a turbine power stations), it is more practical and advantageous to keep the coil fix ed and to rotate the magnetic field (of an electromagnet) around the coil. In this way, instead of the coil cutting the magnetic field as in the simple a.c. generator, the magnetic field cuts the coil to produce the induced e.m.f. Hence we can do away wit h the slip rings and the carbon brushes which are not capable of carrying large currents in and out of the coil.

The transformer   A transformer is a device that changes a high alternating voltage (at low current) to a low alternating voltage (at high current) , or vice versa. It is a useful electrical device that is essential for: \u2022 electrical power transmission from power station s to the consuming loads (households and factories)  \u2022 regulating voltages for proper operation of electrical appliances such as mains -operated TV and record player         The structure of a closed -core transformer basically consists of two coils of wi res (primary  and secondary ) of an appropriate number of turns. These coils are wound on a laminated soft- iron core for reducing heat loss in the core.", "Electromagnetic-Induction/9": "  a) b) c) d) Sec4/ Physics/EMI -notes Page 9 of 11 SS PPVN = VN VS = secondary output voltage VP = primary input voltage NS = number of turns in secondary coil NP = number of turns in primary coil  IP VP = IS VS IP = current in the primary coil  IS = current in the secondary coil  VS = secondary output voltage VP = primary input voltage  The principle of operation \u2022 it transfers electrical energy supplied from the primary coil to the second ary coil by electromagnetic induction between the two coils  \u2022 at the primary coil, the applied alternating voltage sets up an alternating magnetic field to cut the secondary coil. This gives rise to a rate of change of magnetic field across the secondary coi l, and therefore an induced alternating e.m.f. is produced \u2022 a step -up transformer is one where the e.m.f. in the secondary coil is greater than the e.m.f. in the primary coil.

For a step -up transformer, N S > N P. Conversely, for a step-down transformer, N S < N P.     For an ideal transformer (i.e.", "Electromagnetic-Induction/10": " 100% efficient), the power supplied to the primary coil is fully transferred to the secondary coil. Hence by the principle of conservation of energy, power in primary coil = power in secondary coil    3. Causes of loss of efficiency in a transformer  \u2022 Flux leakage : It is essential that all the flux generated by the primary passes through the secondary. This is best achieved by winding the primary on top of the secondary; and having a \u2018closed\u2019 iron core. \u2022 Loss due to heating effect of eddy currents : The metal core is a conducto r and the magnetic field varies continually. Hence an e.m.f. and consequently a current are induced in it. If the core is solid, it acts in effect as a secondary of one turn and a very large current is induced. The heating effect is proportional to the square of the current and is therefore quite large. The effect is very considerably reduced by using a bundle of very thin metal stampings (laminations) insulated from each other. Then the current induced in each is very small and there is only a small heatin g effect.  \u2022 Copper losses : These represent the energy lost by heating of the wire in both the primary and secondary coils ( because \u221d I2R ). \u2022 Hysteresis losses : The magnetic field in the core is in one direction 50 times each second and in the opposite direction 50 times each second. Consequently the domains are continually changing their alignment.", "Electromagnetic-Induction/11": " The energy needed to effect this is taken from the input energy.

The current through the primary is 125 mA. What is the efficiency of the transformer?          E. Transmission of Electricity  1. Transmitting electricity economically  Electricity is transmitted from one part of the country to another by the grid syste m and is carried by the pylons and wires strung across the countryside. Can you still see all these in Singapore? If not, how are the wires carried around the island? One of the problems in the transmission and distribution of electrical energy is the pow er loss as heating ( I 2R) in the grid cables. One solution is to have very thick cables so that the resistance R is low. Then the power lost as heat in the cables will be a minimum. However, there is a limit to the extent to which this can be done.", "Electromagnetic-Induction/12": " The thic ker the cable used, the heavier is the weight to be supported and hence the higher the construction cost. Sec4/ Physics/EMI -notes Page 11 of 11 Another solution is to reduce the current I in transfer. This can be done by using transformers to step up the voltage at which the electrical power is to be transmitted. The greater the value of the voltage, the lower the power loss. Hence electrical power can be transmitted more economically at high voltage and low current      2. Alternating current and direct current  Direct current was used at one time, but alternating current is now preferred. Why ?  Because it can be stepped up and down much more easily. Direct current cannot be used with a transformer because a changing magnetic field is required . To step up d.c. voltages is quite a complicated process. To step it down involves using resistors in series and a considerable amount of energy is lost as heat.

Current will flow through the coil in the direction shown, and by applying Fleming\u2019s LH rule, it will be seen \nthat the side ab  of the coil experiences an upward force and the side cd  a downward force. These \ntwo forces form a couple  which causes the coil to rotate in a clockwise direction until it reaches \nthe vertical position. In this position, the brushes touch the space between the two halves of the \ncommutator and the current is cut off. The coil does not come to rest, since its momentum carries \nit past the vertical, and when this has occurred, the two commutator halves automatically change contact from one brush to the other. This reverses the current through the coil, and consequently \nalso reverses the  directions of the forces on the sides of the coil.

Introduction \nSome objects (e.g. glass ro d or ebonite rod) acquire a new property of being able to attract \nsmall pieces of paper after they have been rubbed with another material (e.g. silk or fur, \nrespectively). This phenomenon belongs to the branch of physics called electrostatics  or \nstatic electricity . It involves the study of static electric charges. Before rubbing, these objects \ndo not attract small pieces of paper. This implies that friction due to rubbing has changed the nature of the surfaces of the rods. We say that friction has caused the rods to be \u2018electrified\u2019 or \u2018charged\u2019.  \n \nB. Two types of charges  \nOnly two kinds of charges exist:  positive  charge and negative  charge. (note: in every case, \nequal  amount of opposite  charges are formed)  \n \n \nC. Separation of charges  \n a)   By Friction  \n1. Rub polythene strip with a duster as shown in Fig (a). Test the polythene strip and the \nduster with an electroscope. It can be found that the polythene strip has become negatively \ncharged while the duster is uncharged or neutral. \n Similarly, rub the acetate strip with a duster, as in Fig (b). The acetate strip can be found \nto be positively charged, while the duster again is uncharged. \n /Sec4/Phy sics/Electrostatics   Page 2 of 11 2. How does friction give rise to separation of charges? \n\u2212 Matter is made up of indivisible particles called  atoms . Each atom has negatively charged \nelectrons orbiting round a small massive nucleus which consists of positively charged \nparticles called protons and neutral particles called neutrons, as shown in the diagram. \n\u2212 The normal state of  an atom \nis one that has equal \nnumbers of electrons and protons, i.e. it is electrically balanced or uncharged . \n\u2212 The electrified state is a state in which the electrical balance is upset. This occurs when some electrons are removed (i.e. positively-charged state) from the orbit, or are added to the orbit (i.e. negatively charged state). The atom is \nsaid to have ionised. \n\u2212 Why is the electrical balance upset?    Because the process of rubbing causes energy to be transferred to the outermost electrons to be diss ociated from their orbits.  \n\u2212 In charging by friction (such as rubbing an acetate strip with a duster), some electrons from the surface atoms of one object (the acetate strip) are transferred to another object (the duster). This makes the acetate strip positively charged as it is now short of electrons. The duster becomes negatively charged as it gains excess electrons.  \n\u2212 Why then is the duster neutral in both cases?    In Fig (a), electrons are removed from the duster and go onto the polythene strip where they remain because the polythene is a very \ngood insulator. The duster, which has lost negative charge, acquires a positive charge. \nHowever, the duster is not a good insulator and electrons from earth quickly pass through the hand that holds it and neutralises the positive charge. Thus when the duster is tested for charge, it is found to be uncharged or neutral.      Can you explain the case for Fig (b)?  \n\u2212 N\note that only electrons  are transferred from one object to another . Protons or positive \ncharges do not move  from one place to another . Also, charge is never made or \ndestroyed in the friction process. It is transferred from one material to another (i.e. it is re-distributed). \n  3. Forces between electrically charged bodies  \nSuspend a positively charged acetate st rip on a nylon thread as shown in Fig A (next page) . \nThen bring a negatively charged polythene strip close to it. The acetate strip is seen to swing towards the polythene strip.   Now bring a positively charged acetate strip towards the suspended positive strip as in Fig B. The suspended positive strip is seen to move away.   \n /Sec4/Phy sics/Electrostatics   Page 3 of 11 The conclusions which can be drawn from these tests are: \nLIKE CHARGES REPEL; UNLIKE CHARGES ATTRACT.  \n \n \n            \n   4. Differences between insulators and conductors \nFor one category of materials (e.g. glass, ebonite, polythene, cellulose acetate), the electrons \n(negative charges) are transferred from one material to another and remain on the surface. \nThey do not move about within the material but are confined at the region of \nrubbing . We call such materials electrical insulators  because they do not have free \nelectrons.  \nOn the other hand, materials such as metals allow electrons to flow through them. For this \ncategory of materials, they are not easily electrified by rubbing with silk , fur or duster unless \nthey are well insulated first. We call such materials electrical conductors  because they \nhave free electrons.  \n  5. Neutralizing charged insulators and conductors To neutralize a charged body is to remove the excess charges from it. T his process is also \nknown as discharging.  \nCharged insulators:   \n\u2212 One way to discharge the positively- charged acetate strip is to bring it over a bunsen flame. \nThe intense heat causes the surrounding air of the strip to be ionised into positive and \nnegative ions. These negative ions will neutralise  the excess positive charges on the acetate \nstrip.  \n\u2212 All charged insulators also discharge slowly when left in moist condition. The water vapour in the air causes the excess charges on the insulator to leak away slow ly. \n  \n \n /Sec4/Phy sics/Electrostatics   Page 4 of 11 Charged conductors:  \n\u2212 For a charged conductor such as a metal \nsphere with excess electrons, the \nelectrons can be removed by earthing  it. \nTo earth a charged conductor is to \nprovide a path for the electrons to flow away or towards t he charged conductor \nand cause it to become electrically neutral. The term \u201cearth\u201d refers to any large conductor from which electrons may be taken or to which electrons may be given without it become noticeably charged itself. The first figure on the right shows the neutralizing of a negatively charged metal sphere by means of earthing.  \n\u2212 For a positively charged metal sphere, earthing it will cause the electrons from the earth to flow towards the positively charged sphere and neutralize it, as shown in the next figure.  \n\u2212 In both figures, the purpose of the insulating stand is to prevent any electron flow between the charged metal sphere and the earth. The human body is a relatively good conductor and therefore acts as a conducting path for the electrons. \n  \nb) By Electrostatic Induction \n \n1. A simple experiment \nThe figure shows a light polystyrene sphere which has been coated with a metal (conducting) paint suspended near a positively charged strip. The metal sphere is seen to move towards the positive strip. This phenomena occurs because of electrostatic \ninduction. \n 2. Why do charges separate due to induction? The metal \u2018coated\u2019 sphere is standing in the electric field set up by the charge on the acetate strip. This field causes the separation  of equal amounts of \ncharge on the sphere by induction (influence). Negative charges from within the neutral metal move towards the end nearer the positive strip leaving positive charges at the side of the sphere furthest from the strip.   \n \n /Sec4/ Physics/Electrostatics   Page 5 of 11 3. Some examples of separation of charges by induction \n(i) To charge two conductors with equal and opposite charges  \nStep 1:  The two conductors (metallic spheres) on insulator stands are brought into contact \nwith one another. \nStep 2:  A negatively char ged rod is brought near to sphere A . This causes the electrons from \nA to be repelled to the remote side of B . Under this condition, sphere A  alone will \nhave excess positive charge (due to electron loss) while B  alone has excess negative \ncharge (due to gain  of electrons).  \nStep 3:  With the negatively charged rod in place, the two spheres A  and B  are separated \nusing the  insulating stands. \nStep 4:  Remove the rod. The sphere A will now have induced positive charges while B  will \ncarry an equal number of induced negative charges. The charge on the charging rod remains unchanged. The charges on each sphere will distribute themselves equally on the outside of the conductor. This is because the charges exert forces of repulsion on one another and the charges try to m ove as far apart as they can. The greatest \nseparation they can achieve is w hen they are on the outside of the sphere. \n (ii) To charge a single conductor by induction \n            \n \n \n /Sec4/ Physics/Electrostatics   Page 6 of 11 \n \n Step 1:  Bring a positively -charged rod to the vicinity of the conductor held by an insulating \nstand. \nStep 2:  The free electrons in the conductor will be drawn towards the end of the conductor \nnearer to the positively charged rod, leaving the other remote end to have excess positive charge. Note that the conductor is still electric ally neutral despite the \nredistribution of the free electrons on it. \nStep 3:  With the positively charged rod still in place, the conductor to be charged is earthed. This an be done by touching the conductor with our body momentarily. Being a relatively goo d conductor, our body will allow electrons to flow to the conductor to \nneutralise the excess positive charge on the far side of the conductor. Note that now the conductor will carry an excess negative charge.  \nStep 4:  On removing the charging rod, the exces s negative charge (electrons) will redistribute on the \nsurface of the conductor to attain electrostatic equilibrium.  \n Note also that charging a single conductor by induction will always result in a charge that has the opposite sign to that of the charging rod. The following figure shows how the same conductor can be charged positively.  \n \n  \nD. The Gold- Leaf Electroscope \n \n1. Features  \nThe figure shows the structure of a typical electroscope used for the detection of charges \nand to test for the sign of the charge.  \n 2. Testing for the sign of charge  \nTo test for the sign of a charge on a charged body, we need to charge the electroscope first. The electroscope can be charged easily by induction. The following figures show the sequence of charg ing the electroscope by \ninduction.   \n /Sec4/Phy sics/Electrostatics   Page 7 of 11 Try and explain how the charging works. \n                                    \nE. Electric Potential  \n \nAn electric charge exerts a force on other electric \ncharges. The region in which force is exerted  \nis called an electric field , and it extends an \ninfinite distance away. An uncharged metal sphere \n(in the figure) on an insulating stand has no external electric effect. It does contain many electric charges but, since these are present in equal and opposi te amounts, the overall effect is electric \nneutrality.  \n \n \n \n /Sec4/ Physics/Electrostatics   Page 8 of 11 If a metal sphere A  [as shown in Fig (a)] acquires a small positive charge (by the removal of \nnegative charges from the sphere), the charge acquired can exert a force of attraction on \nnegative charges and a force of repulsion on positive charges. The acquisition of the positive charge is said to raise the electric potential of the sphere so that it is greater than that of the Earth (taken as zero potential). A small positive charge raises the sphere t o a \u2018small\u2019 positive \npotential +v. If an identical sphere B  [as shown in Fig (b)] were to acquire more positive \ncharge it would be raised to an even higher positive potential +V . Hence sphere B  is at a \nhigher positive potential than sphere A . \n \nIf the spheres B  and A  are connected by an insulated \nwire as shown in the figure, charge will flow because of the potential difference ( V - v) between the two \nspheres. Positive charge, if it were free to move, would flow from high positive potential +V  to lower \npositive potential +v. Negative charges (electrons) flow from A  to B,  i.e. towards the higher positive \npotential, until the potentials of A  and B  become \nequal. The removal of negative charge from A  will \nresult in an effective gain of positive charge, hence the potential of A  becomes greater than +v. The gain of negative charge by sphere B  results in \nan effective loss (neutralization) of some positive charge, hence the potential of B  is lowered \nto less than +V . Electrons s top flowing when the potential of B  equals the potential of A , i.e. \nwhen the potential difference is zero.  \n \n \nF. Electric Field  \n \nAn electric field can be illustrated by drawing lines of electric force. These lines represent the directio n of \nacceleration of a small \u2018free\u2019 positive charge placed in the field. The density of the lines is used to indicate the strength of the field. Thus the lines of electric force are directed away from the positively charged spheres but towards the negative ly charged \nspheres, as shown in the figure. The closer the field lines, the stronger is the electric field in that region. It can be observed that the field lines are closer together when they are near the \n \n \n /Sec4/ Physics/Electrostatics   Page 9 of 11 charges. This means that the strength of the field  is stronger nearer the charge, and decreases \nfurther away from the charge.  \n \nThe figure illustrates a uniform electric field \nbetween two parallel oppositely charged plates. The electric lines of force at the central region are parallel  to each other and \nequally spaced. The greater number of lines indicates a stronger uniform electric field.  \n The following figure shows the field pattern set up by a pair of charges placed close together  \n  \nG.

A precipitator is made up of a number of wires and plates. The wires are made negatively charged so that they can charge the ash particles negatively when passing through.  \n The collector plates are made positively charged to attract and collect the ash particles.

The electrostatic precipitation technique is also important in steel, cement and chemical industries which release large quan tities of flue gases.  \n  2.

Lightning  \nThis is due to a large quantity of electric charge being built up in the heavy thunderclouds.

This explains why it is very dangerous to swim in the open sea, play in an open field or hide under a tree \nduring a thunderstorm. To prevent lightning from damaging tall buildings, lightning conductors are used.

A. Introduction Some objects (e.g. glass ro d or ebonite rod) acquire a new property of being able to attract small pieces of paper after they have been rubbed with another material (e.g. silk or fur, respectively). This phenomenon belongs to the branch of physics called electrostatics or static electricity . It involves the study of static electric charges. Before rubbing, these objects do not attract small pieces of paper. This implies that friction due to rubbing has changed the nature of the surfaces of the rods. We say that friction has caused the rods to be \u2018electrified\u2019 or \u2018charged\u2019.   B. Two types of charges  Only two kinds of charges exist: positive charge and negative charge. (note: in every case, equal amount of opposite charges are formed)    C. Separation of charges  a)  By Friction  1. Rub polythene strip with a duster as shown in Fig (a). Test the polythene strip and the duster with an electroscope.", "Electrostatics/1": " It can be found that the polythene strip has become negatively charged while the duster is uncharged or neutral.  Similarly, rub the acetate strip with a duster, as in Fig (b). The acetate strip can be found to be positively charged, while the duster again is uncharged.  /Sec4/Phy sics/Electrostatics  Page 2 of 11 2. How does friction give rise to separation of charges? \u2212 Matter is made up of indivisible particles called atoms . Each atom has negatively charged electrons orbiting round a small massive nucleus which consists of positively charged particles called protons and neutral particles called neutrons, as shown in the diagram. \u2212 The normal state of an atom is one that has equal numbers of electrons and protons, i.e. it is electrically balanced or uncharged . \u2212 The electrified state is a state in which the electrical balance is upset. This occurs when some electrons are removed (i.e. positively-charged state) from the orbit, or are added to the orbit (i.e. negatively charged state). The atom is said to have ionised. \u2212 Why is the electrical balance upset?  Because the process of rubbing causes energy to be transferred to the outermost electrons to be diss ociated from their orbits.", "Electrostatics/2": "  \u2212 In charging by friction (such as rubbing an acetate strip with a duster), some electrons from the surface atoms of one object (the acetate strip) are transferred to another object (the duster). This makes the acetate strip positively charged as it is now short of electrons. The duster becomes negatively charged as it gains excess electrons.  \u2212 Why then is the duster neutral in both cases?  In Fig (a), electrons are removed from the duster and go onto the polythene strip where they remain because the polythene is a very good insulator. The duster, which has lost negative charge, acquires a positive charge.

Nevertheless, experiments with very powerful magnets have shown that even the so-called non -magnetic substan ces have very feeble magnetic properties.  \n \nTest for polarity of a magnet  \nThe polarity of any magnet may be tested by bringing both its poles, in turn, near to the known poles of a suspended magnet.  \nRepulsion will indicate similar polarity.  \nIf attract ion occurs, no firm conclusion can be drawn, since attraction would be obtained \nbetween either:  \n- two unlike poles, or \n- a pole and a piece of unmagnetized material.  \nRepulsion is, therefore, the only sure test for polarity.  \n \n \nTo magnetize a steel bar  \n \na) By an electrical method  \nThe best method of making magnets is to use the magnetic effect of an electric current. A cylindrical coil wound with 500 or more turns of insulated copper wire is connected in series with a 6 V or 12 V electric battery and switch ( see diagram). A coil of this type is called a \nsolenoid. A steel bar is placed inside the coil and the current switched on and off. On removing and testing the bar, it is found to be magnetized. It is unnecessary to leave the current on for any length of ti me, as the bar will not become magnetized any more strongly \nand the coil may be damaged through over-heating.  The polarity of the magnet depends on the direction of flow of the current. If, on looking at the \nend of the bar, the current is flowing in a clockwise direction, that end will be a S -pole; if \nanticlockwise, it will be a N -pole.  \n  b) By the stroking methods               \n Sec4/ Physics/Magnet ism-notes  Page 3 of 5 \n \n \n Demagnetization  \nThe best way of demagnetizing a magnet is to \nplace it inside a solenoid through which an alternating c urrent is flowing. The current \nmay be obtained from a 12 V or 24 V mains transformer. While the current is still flowing, the magnet is withdrawn slowly to a distance of several metres from the so lenoid in a West-\nEast direction . The alternating current takes \nthe magnet through a series of ever -diminishing magnetic cycles, fifty times a second, until it \nis completely demagnetized. The magnet is held in an E- W direction so that it will not be left \nwith some residual magnetism owing to induction in the earth\u2019s  magnetic field.  \n Another method of destroying magnetism is to heat the magnet to redness and then to allow it to cool while is is lying in an E -W direction. This is not recommended as a practical method, \nsince heat treatment will spoil the steel.  \nAlso, any vibration or rough treatment, such as dropping or hammering, particularly when the magnet is lying E -W, will cause weakening of the magnetism.  \n \nInduced magnetism  \nWhen a piece of unmagnetised steel is placed either near to or in contact with a pole of a magnet and then removed, it is found to be magnetized. This is called induced magnetism . Tests with a compass needle \nshow that the induced pole nearest the magnet is of opposite sign to that of the inducing pole.  \n Induced magnetism can be used to form a \u201cmagnetic chain\u201d as shown in the diagram. Each nail added to the chain magnetizes the next one by induction, and attraction occurs between their adjacent unlike poles.  \n  \nMagnetic properties of Iron and Steel  \nThe term \u201csoft\u201d as applied to iron means reasonably pure iron. It is otherwise known as wrought iron, and is soft in the sense that it bends easily and can be readily hammered into any required shape when red hot. Steel, which consists of iron combined with a small percentage of carbon, is a much harder and stronger material.  \n A strip of soft iron and a strip of steel of the same dimensions, both initially unmagnetized, are placed side by side in contact with a pole of a magnet as shown. Both strips become magnetized by induction, and on dipping their free ends into iron filings it is noticed that slightly more cling to the iron than to the steel. From this we conclude that the induced magnetism in the iron is slightly greater than that in the steel when both are subjected to the same magnetizi ng force.  \n  Sec4/ Physics/Magnet ism-notes  Page 4 of 5 If both strips are held firmly in the fingers while the magnet is removed, it is noticed that \npractically all the filings fall from the iron, while few, if any, fall from the steel. The magnetic chain experiment illustrated previously may als o be used to show the difference \nbetween iron and steel. If the topmost nail is held between finger and thumb while the magnet is removed, the chain immediately collapses, showing that the induced magnetism in the iron is only temporary . When, however, the experiment is carried out using steel pen nibs or short \npieces of clockspring, the chain remains intact, showing that the magnetism induced in the steel is permanent . \n  \nFerromagnetism. The domain theory of magnetism  \nIn some materials, of which iron, s teel and certain alloys are outstanding examples, the \natomic magnets or dipoles do not act independently. Instead small groups of dipoles interact \nwith one another so that their magnetic axes spontaneously line up together in a certain preferred direction. Groups such as these are described as magnetic domain . In the \n\u201cunmagnetized\u201d state, the resultant magnetic axes of the domains point in all directions at random and so the bar as a whole shows no polarity.  \n This condition is illustrated below in which, f or simplicity, the domains are drawn as uniform \ncubes. In actual fact, however, the domains are not at all cubical in shape but can vary in size and their edges will lie in different directions from grain to grain throughout the whole material. The atomic magnets or dipoles have been represented by a dot and arrow, and the arrow head signifies the N -pole.  \n           \n \n       If the bar is placed in a gradually increasing magnetic field (e.g. inside a solenoid with steadily increasing current, then in some of the domains all the atomic dipoles may turn out of their preferred directions so that their axes all come into a new direction more closely related to that of the magnetizing field.    \n Sec4/ Physics/Magnet ism-notes  Page 5 of 5 Eventually, if the magnetizing field is strong enough, the resultant magnetic axes of all the \ndomains will be brought into the best possible alignment with the field and the material is said to be magnetically saturated, as shown above. We now have free atomic poles at the ends of the bar which will give rise to the poles of the magnet. Finally, when the magnetizing field is removed, the mutual repulsion between the free atomic poles at the ends of the bar will cause the domain axes to fan out slightly. This explains why the poles of a bar magnet are never situated exactly  at its ends.  \n \nFurther work : read up on paramagnetism , and diamagnetism  \n  \nKeepers  \nA bar magnet tends to become weaker with age, owing to self -demagnetization . This is \ncaused by the poles at the ends of the magnet which tend to reverse the direction of the atomic dipoles inside it. In order to prevent this, bar magnets are stored in pairs, with their opposite poles adjacent and with small pieces of soft iron, called keepers, placed across their \nends, as shown.  \n              These keepers become strong  induced magnets, and the opposite induced poles at their ends \nneutralize the poles of the bar magnets. In other words, the magnetic dipoles in the domains of both magnets and keepers form closed loops with no free poles. Consequently the \ndemagnetizing eff ect disappears.  \n \n     \n----- end ----- \n ", "Magnetism/0": "Topic is Magnetism; Sec4/ Physics/Magnet ism-notes Page 1 of 5  Hwa Chong Institution ( High School ) Name : ______________________ (   )  PHYSICS Notes Class : __________  Magnetism Date : __________   Properties of Magnets   a) Magnetic poles  When a bar magnet is dipped into iron filings, it is noticed that the filings cling in tufts near the ends.

Reflections or echoes are received from any surfaces  within the body which have either a different density or a \ndifferent structure or elasticity. By noting the time interval, the depth of the reflecting surface within the body may be known. The reflections in different directions can be used to build up an image of something inside.  \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \nThe following website simulates the use of ultrasound imaging as a technique used to \"see\" the inside of an object:         http://electronics.ho wstuffworks.com/ultrasound4.htm\n \n The advantage of using ultrasound rather than X -rays is that ultrasound is safer. X -rays are \nknown to damage cells by ionisation. Ultrasound can be used continuously to watch the \nmovement of an unborn baby or a person's heart without any injury or risk to the patient. \nUltrasound can detect some differences between soft tissues in the body which X -rays cannot. \nIn this way, it is sometimes able to find tumours or lumps inside the body.  \n 2. Ultrasound in cleaning \n \nThe transmis sion of high energy ultrasound may result in the creation of cavitation bubbles. \nCavitation bubbles are created at sites of rarefaction.

The greater the amplitude, the louder is the note because more energy is used to produce a larger amplitude.          c)  Quality (or Timbre)  The quality or timbre is the richness of the sound, and depends upon the number of overtones  present, i.e. the quality of a note is determined by the overt ones.", "Sound/5": "         Note : \uf0d8 the pitch and loudness of sounds have no effect on the velocity of sound in air  \uf0d8 changes of pressure also have no effect on the velocity of sound in air  \uf0d8 but, the velocity of sound in air increases with temperature         Sec4/Physics/S ound- note Page 5 of 5 8. Ultrasound  a) Definition  Sound with frequencies above the upper limit of human audible frequency range is known as ultrasound. Generally, ultrasonic frequencies are found in the region above 20 kHz .  b) Applications of ultrasound   1. Ultrasound in medical diagnosis   Used to obtain images of the internal parts of the body. Commonly used in pre -natal examination to examine the development of the foetus.  Ultrasound pulses are sent into the body by means of a transmitter. Reflections or echoes are received from any surfaces within the body which have either a different density or a different structure or elasticity. By noting the time interval, the depth of the reflecting surface within the body may be known. The reflections in different directions can be used to build up an image of something inside.            The following website simulates the use of ultrasound imaging as a technique used to \"see\" the inside of an object:     http://electronics.", "Sound/6": "ho wstuffworks.com/ultrasound4.htm  The advantage of using ultrasound rather than X -rays is that ultrasound is safer. X -rays are known to damage cells by ionisation. Ultrasound can be used continuously to watch the movement of an unborn baby or a person's heart without any injury or risk to the patient. Ultrasound can detect some differences between soft tissues in the body which X -rays cannot. In this way, it is sometimes able to find tumours or lumps inside the body.  2. Ultrasound in cleaning  The transmis sion of high energy ultrasound may result in the creation of cavitation bubbles. Cavitation bubbles are created at sites of rarefaction. These cavitation bubbles may displace contaminant from surfaces. This effect also allows fresh chemicals to come into c ontact with the contaminant remaining on the surface to be removed.  Ultrasonic cleaning is especially effective in the cleaning of irregular surfaces or internal cavities and passageways.
